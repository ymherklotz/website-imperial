YAGE is a fully featured 2D game engine written in C++ using OpenGL to render
textured quads to the screen. It also includes an efficient and extensible
Entity Component System to handle many different game objects. In addition to
that, it provides a simple interface to draw shapes to a window and efficient
texturing using Sprite Batching.

## Goal of the Engine

YAGE is a personal project that I started to learn about computer graphics,
using tools like modern OpenGL to learn about the graphics pipeline and common
optimisations that are used in a lot of game engines.

However, writing the complete engine has taught me a lot more in addition to
that, such as efficient memory management by taking advantage of caching to keep
load times short and the number of textures that can be drawn high.
