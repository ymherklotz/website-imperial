  Hi, my name is Yann and I enjoy low level programming using C and C++. I am
  currently in my final year studying Electronic and Information Engineering at
  Imperial College London. The course focuses on computers, from coding theory
  to the design and architecture of a CPU, to high level programming. I also
  enjoy the concepts and mathematics behind functional programming, to make
  software easier to test and write.

      Most of my programming experience is in C++, mostly working on low level
      programming such as designing a [Game
      Engine](https://github.com/ymherklotz/YAGE). I also enjoy functional
      programming, and have written a project using F# called
      [FMark](https://github.com/ymherklotz/FMark) with a team of four other
      students for our Higher Level Programming module. I also have experience
      in Haskell and test driven development.

      Participating in many group projects at university, and working in a team
      at work, I have learned to work well and coordinate with other
      people. Working on [FMark](https://github.com/ymherklotz/FMark) I assumed
      a leadership role and learned how to assign different tasks effectively.

      I am also very interested in low-power hardware design, especially using
      FPGAs. I have industry experience in System Verilog, designing test
      benches, and have used Verilog in first and second year at university.

      Hardware Verification Engineering Intern at Arm for three months, where I
      worked on developing different workflows used to build test benches that
      verify the GPU. I then moved to the Software Department working on
      simulating and visualising what happens in GPU.

      Teacher at Turinglab, which teaches coding in a visual way using
      Javascript and the p5.js library. This makes coding much more interesting
      for young children that want to learn, and enjoy making simple games with
      the library, which can teach them many different aspects of programming.
