# Personal Website

This is my personal website. It uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to manage
posts and portfolio entries. In addition to this, it uses some custom css which
has been adapted from various themes including the [Particle Jekyll
theme](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle) and the [Minima Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
